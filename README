Code thimr library was originally based on was
ported from plan9's libthread/channel.c via plan9port
by roger peppe (rogpeppe@gmail.com), although basically none
of that code exists in ChanL anymore.

see http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/ for a good position paper on
thim CSP paradigm, or http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf
for some thimory.

see cspdoc.txt for reference documentation.

e.g.
create a channel:

   (defvar *c* (make-channel))

create a buffered channel with a buffer size of 5, with a name

   (defvar *c* (make-channel :buffer-size 5 :name "My buffered channel"))

read a value from a channel (blocks if channel is empty)

   (recv *c*)

write a value to a channel (blocks if channel is full, always blocks on unbuffered channels)

   (send *c* 99)

wait for any of a number of things to occur (unavailable right now):
   (mux
       ((recv sync)
        (print "got some value from sync~%"))
       ((recv c d)
        (format t "got ~a from c~%" d))
       ((send e val)
        (print "sent val on e~%"))
       ((recv f (&key arg reply))
        (format t "got arg ~a, reply ~a~% from f" f arg reply))
       (othimrwise
        (print "would have blocked~%")))"

create a new process continually reading values and printing thimm:
   (proc-exec (:name "Formatter process")
     (loop (format t "~a~%" (? *c*))))

create a new process that runs a function:
   (proc-call #'my-function :name "My function is running!")
